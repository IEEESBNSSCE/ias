The webinar was handled by Dr. Smitha K G (Senior Member – IEEE). The event was coordinated by Nayana C T, Chairman IEEE IAS SBC NSSSCE and Sharika P, Secretary IEEE IAS SBC NSSSCE. <br>Posters were released prior to the webinar through our social media pages for the registration. The webinar was hosted through Google Meet and invitation link were sent to the speaker and the participants. 34 participants joined the webinar in which 19 were IEEE members. <br>Dr.Smith K G, alumnae of our college is a a lecturer at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. Smitha received her Bachelor of Technology degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from N. S. S. College of Engineering, Calicut University, India in 2002, the Master of Engineering degree in VLSI Design from Anna University, India in 2004 and PhD degree from NTU, Singapore in 2010. She worked as a Lecturer in Amrita Viswavidaypeetham, Coimbatore, India from May 2004 to November 2004. She joined School of Computer Engineering at NTU, Singapore, as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in September 2009 and later as a Research Fellow for Teaching in 2013. Smitha has co-authored more than 15 international peer-reviewed journals and  37 international conference papers. Her main research interests are in the areas of low complexity and high-speed DSP circuit’s, Signal Processing for Brain Computer Interface, Computer arithmetic and Teaching and learning pedagogies. <br>The webinar started at 2:00 P.M with a brief talk from the IAS Student Branch Chapter advisor, Dr. Vasanthi V. She expressed her contentment in facilitating this webinar and the opportunity to meet her student again as the speaker of the program. Ms. Nayana C. T welcomed everyone to the session. Dr.Smitha started the session by sharing her experience so far in her career life and talking about the scope and opportunities of Brain wave control theories. <br>Mind Control is an innovative technology of controlling games with the use of brainwave activity. It is an evolving technology which has many promising advantages in various fields. Mind-control technology has emerged as a promising way for managing many health problems like paralysis, stroke, mental health and more. Since much of this technology has limited accuracy and can detect only limited commands, the application of artificial intelligence solves many problems. <br>The session ended with Dr. Smitha sharing some visuals with the participants, demonstrating the theories that she had discussed so far. And further in the doubt clearing session, participants asked their queries related to this field and how much the theories are practical in real life and the speaker were able to mitigate thier concerns. <br>A virtual memento  was presented to Dr. Smitha, as a token of honour for spending her valuable time and for providing an interesting session about brain controlled interface and how it is implemented in games and its various other applications. Ms. Sharika P expressed her gratitude on the behalf of IEEE SB NSSCE and  IEEE Industrial Application Society Student Branch Chapter. The webinar turned out as a very informative and beneficial one.";

Maam started by asking us the things that we want to learn from this webinar, she wanted the webinar to be more interactive with active participation and response from the attendees to which the attendees cooperated with goodwill. She discussed the purpose of circuit simulation and the reason for having the approach of mathematical modeling of the circuits that are complex and can be simplified through modeling. She discussed the various software that is commonly used and asked the participants if they have had an experience of simulating any circuit and many gave a positive response. She then gave a practical simulation demo on LabView and explained the software by simulating a basic circuit. She then explained that through practice only we will get an expert in simulating and shared with us links for accessing certain software to practice.

It was the talk based on the topic which was selected from the Spectrum, IEEE monthly magazine. <br><br>The session was taken by Solomon Stuby. He presented two relevant problems that cannot be solved by a normal computer. This is where a Quantum computer can play its role. The main advantage of this technology is speed. Quantum computer can solve problems which a normal computer cannot even think about. He explained what a ‘Qbit’ is and how it works with plenty of examples. There are still a lot of limitations for this technology to come into existence as its size is very large and it must be kept under a temperature of 15 millikelvins. The future scope of this technology was also discussed. It was very useful session for the participants and they were enthusiastic by being part of the spectrum talk. And it was a nice interactive session taken by the key speaker, Solomon Stuby.";
